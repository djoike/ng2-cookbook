Last time: Made features to show ingredient meta and unit data in the ingredient list on the recipe page.

The next step is to be able to make a recipe with ingredients on it :) Right now you can't even create a new recipe without ingredients :D
Perhaps step 1 is to create ingredients on an existing recipe and go from there.
I'm thinking that the ingredient_meta and unit data should be shown as search-as-you-type style input fields. How to do that with Typescript is a challenge, but maybe something like... Writing it out to some HTML element or attribute and having other script handle it? But shouldn't that "other script" also get handled as Typescript? :S Will be much fun...

Long run:
Consider if recipes and ingredients should get cached as is units and ingredient-metas.
Security.
