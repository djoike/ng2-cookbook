Last thing: Made a new component for ingredients list. Made a service for it, as well as backend functions. Tested it so far.
It still lacks any save/delete/update features.

Next step: Now that I can render the ingredients as a list, we need to make those unit_id and ingredient_meta_ids translate into the actual information we want. The tricky part here is that we don't want the same component template as in the main unit component (for example).
What I thought of so far about this:
Either A: make a new component entirely, which relies on the same service or B: see if it's possible to use the same component with a different template.

After getting that to work the next step is to be able to make a recipe with ingredients on it :) Right now you can't even create a new recipe without ingredients :D

Long run: Consider if recipes and ingredients should get cached as is units and ingredient-metas.
